The research paper I am considering replicating is Streaky Hitting in Baseball by Jim Albert that was published in the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports. The research project uses a consistent-p model, using p-values as a measure the extremeness of a playerâ€™s streaky statistic. The topic of streakiness has steered much debate over the years and I am particularly interested by the methods by which Albert uses to analyze them. The data and code is not provided, but I have emailed Jim Albert asking for them both.

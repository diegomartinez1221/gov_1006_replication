# gov_1006_replication



This is a replication project for Gov 1006 at Harvard University taught by Preceptor David Kane.

I am replicating Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots  by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. They seek to answer how politicians with local roots have greater appeal in elections.

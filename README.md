# Replication of "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots



This is a replication project for Gov 1006 at Harvard University taught by Preceptor David Kane.

Campbell et al. (2019) find evidence that local roots serve as a cue for behavioral information; however, they still find local roots to possess a positive impact on candidate selection. I was successfully able to replicate all the results presented in the original article "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots." by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. To further their analysis, I modeled how local roots influence different sub-populations, including male vs. female voters, as well as between different age groups. I found the average treatment effect of local roots are not constant across subsets of the population. Furthermore, I found the average marginal effect of local roots to have substantial differences between males and females. Local roots affect groups of voters differently and any further research regarding local roots should account for demographic differences.

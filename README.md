# gov_1006_replication



This is a replication project for Gov 1006 at Harvard University taught by Preceptor David Kane.

Campbell et al (2019) show that candidate's with shared local roots appeals to voters and that having local roots is an important factor in a voter's candidate selection. I was successfully able to replicate all the results presented in the orignal article "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots." by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. To further their analysis, I modeled how local roots influence different sub-populations including male vs. female voters as well as between different age groups. I found the average marginal effect of local roots to not remain constant across subgroups, meaning local roots affect groups of voters differently. Thus, any further research regarding local roots effects should consider the gender as well as age makeup of the sample.
